 * Mainstream science is finally recognizing the medicinal properties of ant honey, a substance indigenous Australians have been using for centuries.
 * According to a new study, this sweet substance carries strong antimicrobial properties. Indigenous Australians have been using ant honey for generations to treat colds and sore throats.
 *
 * Scientists from the University of Sydney’s Carter Lab, led by Professor Dee Carter, studied the Australian honeypot ant.
 * This ant species is found in desert areas, mainly in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The honey these ants make isn’t stored in cells in hives but inside other ants.
 * Certain ants in their colonies are fed flower juice by other ants until their bellies swell to the size of grapes. Then when food is scarce, the honey-filled ants vomit up (吐出) their sweet liquid for the other ants to eat.
 *
 * “For our people, honey ants are more than just a food source.
 * Digging for them is a very enjoyable way of life and a way of bringing the family together,” says Danny Ulrich who operates honeypot ant tours in Western Australia.
 * “Our people have been enjoying sweet honey ants for thousands of years. As for its medicinal use, we use it for sore throats and sometimes as a skin cream to help keep infections from getting worse.”
 *
 * The study conducted by the Carter Lab marks the first time that ant honey has been investigated for its medicinal properties. The researchers found that ant honey possesses “unique” antimicrobial activity against bacteria.
 * They confirmed that its mechanism of action is different from that of Manuka honey, a well-established treatment for wounds and skin infections. Manuka honey is produced from the flowers of a native New Zealand tree.
 *
 * “Our research shows that honeypot ant honey possesses a distinctive effect that sets it apart from other types of honey,” says Dr. Kenya Fernandes from the Carter Lab team.
 * “This discovery means that honeypot ant honey could contain compounds with substantial antimicrobial power; identifying these could provide us with starting points for developing new and different types of antibiotics.”
